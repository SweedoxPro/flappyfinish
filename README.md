# FLAPPY BIRD
Flappy bird flew into an endless pipe zone (or is it?) and needs help flying through to get out.  

# ABOUT THE GAME
A simple side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird to fly between pipes without hitting them.  Flying between each set of pipes scores 1 point and hitting them or the ground ends the game.  See how long you can last and set records.
